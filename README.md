## About
This repository includes the code used for the research published as Burgos-M치rmol, J.J.; Patti, A. Molecular Dynamics of Janus Nanodimers Dispersed in
Lamellar Phases of a Block Copolymer. *Polymers* **2021**, 13, 1524. doi: [10.3390/polym13091524](https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13091524). The content of this repository can be listed as follows:

- A ``FORTRAN`` file that generates LAMMPS scripts and LAMMPS data files.
- A ``FORTRAN`` file for structural analysis.
- A ``FORTRAN`` file for dynamical analysis.
- A ``Python`` script to remove duplicated configurations from linear trajectories and create a single long log trajectory from 100 shorter log trajectories.
- A series of LAMMPS scripts
